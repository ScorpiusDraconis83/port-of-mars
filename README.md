## About

[Port of Mars](https://interplanetary.asu.edu/port-of-mars) is an interdisciplinary research project sponsored by [Arizona State University's](https://www.asu.edu) [Interplanetary Initiative](https://interplanetary.asu.edu/). Its original incarnation was designed and implemented as a physical card game for 5 players. We are now a developing digital version of the Port of Mars card game to serve as a scalable research testbed for studying collective action.

## Build the Codebase

### Development Setup

To create a development environment for your client and server run

```bash
./configure dev
make secrets
make
```

This creates secrets for the database, creates a `docker-compose.yml` file and builds the `client` and `server` docker images.

Now run

```
docker-compose up -d
```

and you should have a working development environment.

In order to login fixtures for the project need to be loaded. This can be done with

```
docker-compose exec server bash
yarn load-fixtures
```

Since the project hasn't been released yet there are no DB migrations. If a schema change occurs then
you can update the schema of your development DB with `yarn typeorm schema:sync`. If that doesn't work
it's best to start from scratch

```
yarn typeorm schema:drop
yarn typeorm schema:sync
yarn load-fixtures
```

Now you should be able to login using the usernames in the `fixtures/User.yml` file.

Tests for the project must be setup before they are run. Be sure to run

```
make test-setup
```

before trying to run and tests.

Tests for the project can be run with

```
make test
```

You should be able to go to a game instance by logging in as 'bob' on the login page. You should be taken to a game instance.

If you just want to update the `docker-compose.yml` you can run `make docker-compose.yml`.

To get `make browser` working you'll need to install an Firefox extension so that you open container tabs from the command line. See https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-url-in-container/


### Staging Setup

```bash
./configure staging
make secrets
make
docker-compose up -d
```

### Production Setup

Copy the Sentry DSN url into `keys/sentry_dsn`. Then 

```bash
./configure prod
make secrets
make
docker-compose up -d
```

### Database Management

To extract the database to csv files run

```bash
yarn cli dump
```

in a development environment or

```bash
yarn cli:prod dump
```

in a staging or production environment inside the server container. This will reproject the game events and summary csv files outlining the state of the game for every game event as well as export game, player and tounnament data. The csv files will be in the `docker/dump` folder.
