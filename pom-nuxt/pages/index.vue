          <p class="w-3/4 mx-auto">
            You are 1 of 5 residents at the Port of Mars, the first long-term
            habitat on the planet. Each game consists of 8 â€”12 rounds, each with
            phases of investing, trading, purchasing, discarding, and reacting
            to Mars events. Chance and player actions impact system health. If
            system health falls to zero all players die.

              Your mission is to stay alive and achieve the most victory points.
              Each round you receive 10 time blocks that you can invest in
              system health or accomplishments. System health will maintain the
              shared infrastructure (upkeep) and keep the team alive.
              Accomplishments will earn you victory points.
